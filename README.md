Event Horizon
=============

**NOTE: major refactoring** underway. Event Horizon started as a promising r&d project that
wasn't production-ready due to its persistence layer not being a highly available datastore.

The v1 was solid as far as the "using application" UX (from code standpoint) was concerned,
so I took what was good in v1 and started building v2 with a better persistence layer (AWS DynamoDB).

New code will land in `pkg/`, and old code will soon be moved under `pkg/legacy/`.

WARNING: expect most documentation below to be out-of-date (until this warning is lifted off).

	  zero downtime.

Architecture summary
--------------------

Writer manages writes to streams. Streams are divided into ~8 MB chunks which
are stored compressed & encrypted in AWS S3, except the last, "live", chunk that
we're writing into.

![](docs/architecture/diagram.png)

Data flow at a glance:

- Somebody contacts Writer to append a line to the stream
- Writer notifies pub/sub that a stream has new lines
- All interested applications that want to read from any streams have a Pusher,
  which subscribes to pub/sub notifications for those streams.
- Once the Pusher learns of new events, it issues a read to either:
	- a Writer if it's live data OR
	- S3 if it's older data.
- Pusher then pushes this read to your application. Your application transactionally
  verifies that the read offset is at the offset of last stored write in database.
  If not, error is returned along with the correct offset, and Pusher continues
  to read from the correct offset.


Programming language support
----------------------------

To use EventHorizon somewhere, that language has to be able to receive events over
HTTP + JSON, in just one HTTP path. There's even a helper library (pushlib - look
at the architecture diagram) for that, and it's only a small amount of code.

Existing implementations of pushlib:

- Go
	- [library](pusher/pushlib/) managed in this main repo
	- [example application](https://github.com/function61/eventhorizon-exampleapp-go)
- node.js (coming soon)
- PHP (coming soon)
- Your programming language not yet supported?
	- It's somewhat easy to implement - contributions appreciated :)
